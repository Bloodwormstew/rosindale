This is my variable type website project for my Art and Design 254 Webtype class at Umass Dartmouth. I chose Rosindale as it is very intriguingly fancy yet simple, and the type being inspired by the 1890's (which I know a lot about from working at the Lizzie Borden house) gave me a head start for how I wanted to design this project. The murder house inspired the color scheme and patterns while the wood and brass trim was inspired by the victorian mansions I see in films.
